# Proline site – HTML / JavaScript project

This repository contains a simple front-end web project built with HTML and JavaScript.

The project was created as a self-learning exercise to practice:
- basic JavaScript logic
- DOM manipulation
- structuring a small web project
- deploying a static site via GitHub Pages

I am continuously learning and improving my skills through hands-on projects.
